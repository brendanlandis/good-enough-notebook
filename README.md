# Good Enough Notebook (GEN)

GEN is a collection of no-brand personal utilities, not for "productivity" per se, but for getting your mind off of things you aren't working on right now.

Parts of this app work pretty well, parts are still being prototyped:

- **Todo list:** Works pretty well.
- **Practice routine tracker:** Works ok.
- **Free-writing notepad:** Works ok.

Right now the only way to use this is to download and install it yourself, but in time it will be a web site you can visit and create an account on.

## The idea

We all have a lot going on, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed. We know this already.

Uncluttered software is good, yes, but more lacking in our lives is *humane* software.

I started building this because I needed to stop thinking about ten other things while I'm trying to write music, or focus on a coding problem at work, or frankly even while I'm doing the dishes. Whatever I'm doing on any given day, I just want to be doing that thing, without thinking about the myriad other things I should be doing. I needed a place where I could put all my *stuff* that I could actually *trust* and use without having to click too much.

There are a lot of todo list apps out there, but it always felt difficult and arduous to fit my stuff into them - some were simpler than what I needed, others more complicated. And they were all so concerned with *productivity*.

I'm not worried about productivity. I'm worried about having *presence* with what I'm doing. I want to be able to read more books.

So, I'm making a small suite of tools for myself that will help quiet the part of my brain that worries about doing ten different things *even while I'm trying to do one of the ten things*.
