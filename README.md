# Good Enough Notebook (GEN)

GEN is a collection of no-brand personal utilities, not for "productivity" per se, but for getting your mind off of things you aren't working on right now.

Parts of this app work pretty well, parts are still being prototyped:

- Todo list: Works pretty well.
- Practice routine tracker: Works ok.
- Free-writing notepad: Works ok.

Right now the only way to use this is to download and install it yourself, but in time it will be a web site you can visit and create an account on.
