# Good Enough Notebook (GEN)

GEN is a collection of no-brand personal utilities, not for "productivity" per se, but for getting your mind off of things you aren't working on right now.

Parts of this app work pretty well, parts are still being prototyped:

- **Todo list:** Works pretty well.
- **Practice routine tracker:** Works ok.
- **Free-writing notepad:** Works ok.

Right now the only way to use this is to download and install it yourself, but in time it will be a web site you can visit and create an account on.

## The idea

We all have a lot going on, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Uncluttered software is good, yes, but more lacking in our lives is *humane* software.

I started building this because I need to stop thinking about ten other things while I'm trying to write music, or focus on a coding problem, or hang out with friends. Whatever I'm doing on any given day, I just want to be doing that thing, without thinking about the myriad other things I "should" be doing.

I've always needed a place where I could put all my *stuff* - one that I could actually trust and use without having to click too much. There are a lot of todo list apps out there, but it always felt weird trying to fit my stuff into them - some were simpler than what I needed, others more complex. And they were all so concerned with *productivity*.

I'm not worried about productivity. I'm worried about being *present* with what I'm doing. I want to be able to really choose what I do with my time, not run around trying to do ten things at once and then scrollbrain-dissociate to "relax" afterwards. I wanna read more books, you know?

So, I'm making a small suite of tools for myself that will help quiet the part of my brain that worries about doing ten different things *even while I'm trying to do one of the ten things* (ridiculous!).

The idea is: If it's something that's useful to me, it might be useful to other people too.

## The plan

- Make something I personally want to use, and make it so other people can use it as well.
- Make two versions: An open-source version you can download and self-host, and down the road, a hosted version you can make an account on and use for maybe something like $5 / month.
- No ads, no AI anything, no branding, no extra buttons, no tracking, no nagging, no clutter, no app version, no popups, no stupid emails, just a little web site. A little web site is enough.
- Open formats, easy to export your data and delete your account, etc.
- Just generally treat people that use this web site with respect and dignity.

As of this writing, the project is at v0.1, so this is mostly future-looking stuff. But, that's the plan.

## Usage

If you'd like to use the current version, there is a bit of setup. Without getting too deep into it:
- The backend runs on Strapi, which you'll need to get up and running, and talking to a database. Strapi is pretty good about auto-configuring this stuff for development, and if you just `cd backend` and `npm install` and `npm run develop`, it may just work out of the box.
- Check out the `.env.example` file, which you'll want to configure and rename to `.env`. I've set Strapi up to use AWS for storing media, maybe you'll want to do the same, or not, but either way, the config is in there.
- Open up Strapi, make a user, remember your username.
- With Strapi running, you'll then need to `cd` into the `/frontend` directory, and do another `npm install` and `npm run dev` (not `develop` this time).
- The `/frontend` app has another `.env.example` file, which you'll want to configure and rename to `.env`. (Don't worry about the band stuff for now, that's an experimental feature.)
